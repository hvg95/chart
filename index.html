<div><h1><strong> Hottest October on Record Continues Worrying Climate Trend</strong> </h1>
<h5><em> This follows the hottest September on record, and experts are now saying that it's almost guaranteed that 2023 will be the hottest year on record.</em></h5>
<h6> By Hannah Glaser</h6></div>


<p class="article"> The global average temperature for October was the highest on record, according to Copernicus, the European Union's climate service.  The measured surface temperature was 15.3 degrees Celsius, which when compared to the average of October temperatures from 1990-2020, 14.45 degrees Celsius, is the largest temperature difference from the average, or anomaly, in history. </p>

<p class="article"> The measured sea surface temperature was also up, with a record-breaking anomaly of .58 degrees Celsius.  This trend towards higher average temperatures over time, especially the spike in the last year, has climate scientists concerned about the pace of the Earth's warming.  </p>

</script></div>

<p class="article">This new data also lends an additional sense of urgency to the upcoming COP28 in Dubai, where countries are meeting to find solutions to the global climate crisis.  Per Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S):</p> 

<p class="article">"October 2023 has seen exceptional temperature anomalies, following on from four months of global temperature records being obliterated. We can say with near certainty that 2023 will be the warmest year on record, and is currently 1.43ºC above the preindustrial average. The sense of urgency for ambitious climate action going into COP28 has never been higher”.</p>
